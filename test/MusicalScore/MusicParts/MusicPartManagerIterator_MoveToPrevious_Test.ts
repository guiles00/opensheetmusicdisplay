/**
 * Tests that MusicPartManagerIterator keeps its enrolled (repetition-unrolled) timestamp consistent with its source
 * position when it is moved backwards: moveToPrevious(), used by cursor.previous() and by cursor.update() at the end
 * of the sheet. The enrolled timestamp used to only ever grow - leaving a measure forward added the measure's
 * duration, moving back into it subtracted nothing - so after moving back across a measure boundary
 * CurrentEnrolledTimestamp overstated the position by the measures moved back over, and moving forward again across
 * the same boundary added their durations once more.
 *
 * Sample: OSMD_function_Test_Repeat.musicxml, 4 measures of 4/4 with nested repeats, played in the enrolled order
 * m1 m1 m2 m3 m4 m3 m4 m2 m3 m4 m3 m4 (12 measures = 12 whole notes in total). Every measure has a note on beat 1
 * and rests on beats 2 and 3 (a quarter and a half rest), so the positions of a measure are at +0, +1/4 and +1/2
 * of its start.
 * Repetitions are not unrolled backwards: moveToPrevious() steps to the source-previous measure, so after moving
 * back over a backward jump the enrolled timestamp refers to that measure's most recent pass.
